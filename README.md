## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Interface Polymorphism App (C#)
- Demonstrates **interfaces and polymorphism** in object-oriented programming.
- Defines an `IQuittable` interface and implements it in an `Employee` class.
- Uses polymorphism to call `Quit()` on an interface reference.
- **Skills:** C#, .NET, OOP principles

### 2. Math Console App (C#)
- Performs a simple math operation (multiplication).
- Demonstrates **method calls with positional and named arguments**.
- **Skills:** C#, .NET, console applications

### 3. MoviesDB Assignment (SQL)
- Creates and populates a **Movies database** with Directors and Actors tables.
- Inserts sample data and performs **JOIN queries** to combine results.
- **Skills:** SQL Server, database design, relationships, queries

## 🌱 Reflections
Each project reinforced my growth as a developer:  
- **Interface Polymorphism App:** Taught me how interfaces enable flexible design.  
- **Math Console App:** Strengthened my use of method arguments and clean console outputs.  
- **MoviesDB Assignment:** Deepened my understanding of relational databases and SQL joins.  

These projects reflect my commitment to continuous learning and building a strong technical foundation.
