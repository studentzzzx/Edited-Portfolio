## Projects:
- [Interface Polymorphism App](./Program%20(1).cs)
- [Math Console App](./Program.cs)
- [MoviesDB Assignment](./MoviesDB_Assignment.sql)

### Interface Polymorphism App
A console application that demonstrates **interfaces** and **polymorphism** in C#.  
**Features:**
- Defines an `IQuittable` interface with a `Quit()` method.
- Implements the interface in an `Employee` class.
- Uses polymorphism to call `Quit()` on an interface reference.  
**Tech Stack:** C#, .NET  
**Status:** Completed

### Math Console App
A console application showcasing **method calls with positional and named arguments**.  
**Features:**
- Performs a simple math operation (multiplication).
- Demonstrates named and positional arguments in method calls.  
**Tech Stack:** C#, .NET  
**Status:** Completed

### MoviesDB Assignment
A SQL script that creates and populates a **Movies database**.  
**Features:**
- Creates `Directors` and `Actors` tables with relationships.
- Inserts sample data for directors and actors.
- Performs JOIN queries to retrieve combined data.  
**Tech Stack:** SQL Server  
**Status:** Completed
